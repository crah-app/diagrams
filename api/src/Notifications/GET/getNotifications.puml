note left of "notifications.zip"
    A scan for new notifications is done:
    - everytime the user opens the app
    - everytime going to the area where notifications are displayed

    A check for all the tables is done to see if the timestamp of the row
    is more recent than the timestamp of the last time notifications were checked.
    Notifications are liquid, they never get stored in a table.
end note

note bottom of "notifications.zip"
    A new notification leaves a red dot at the edge to mark it as a new notification
    An old notification (already viewed by the user) is chached and cleared every certain amount of time.
    There must be a setting for how long should old notifications live.
    The user might want to clear a single old notification. He can do that by swiping on it (mobile)
    Or clicking a clear button on desktop

    In the settings the user should be able to 
    deactivate notifications, or disable certain kinds of them.
